Can anyone guess why Australia has lost the war on drugs?

If you criminal corruption is Internationally renowned, don't try to harrass and intimidate me as a victim of violent drug crime (just because I don't need incompetent police to protect me).

In Australia when a person accuses a woman of coercive control, criminal finacial abuse, attempted murder with a weapon, making false police statements, forcing people to agree to protection orders under duress, stealing illegal drugs from stanges with primary school kids in the car - which ones do the poeple that say 'the Fitgerald Enquiry (corruption enquiry) is over' charge?.
