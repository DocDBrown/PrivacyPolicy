Can anyone guess why Australia has lost the war on drugs?

If you criminal corruption is Internationally renowned, don't try to harrass and intimidate me as a victim of violent drug crime (just because I don't need incompetent police to protect me).

In Australia when a person accuses a woman of coercive control (as per police bodycam footage), criminal finacial abuse (as per police bodycam footage), attempted murder with a weapon (as per police bodycam footage), making false police statements, willful damage, shoplifting, forcing people to agree to protection orders under duress, stealing illegal drugs from strangers with primary school kids in the car (as per crime stoppers reports) - which ones do the poeple that say 'the Fitgerald Enquiry (corruption enquiry) is over' charge?. Are the current charges direct retribution in relation to ordering radiology scans on patients assaulted by police? 

One thing everyone can agree on - "WITH NO HONOR THEY SERVE"

Even the Queensland Police motto proves this isnt the first time their lack of honour has been called out

Even if you get a successful political prosecution on the victim and witness of violent drug crime, you still have to answer the National Anti-Corruption Commission and International Criminal Court (Note International Criminal Court proceedings are not just related to these matters)
