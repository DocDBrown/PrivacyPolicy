Can anyone guess why Australia has lost the war on drugs?

If you criminal corruption is Internationally renowned, don't try to harrass and intimidate me as a victim of violent drug crime (just because I don't need incompetent police to protect me).

In Australia when a person accuses a woman of coercive control (as per police bodycam footage), criminal finacial abuse (as per police bodycam footage), attempted murder with a weapon (as per police bodycam footage), making false police statements, forcing people to agree to protection orders under duress, stealing illegal drugs from stanges with primary school kids in the car (as per crime stoppers reports) - which ones do the poeple that say 'the Fitgerald Enquiry (corruption enquiry) is over' charge?. Are the current charges direct retribution in relation to ordering radiology scans on patients assaulted by police? 

One thing everyone can agree on - "WITH NO HONOR THEY SERVE"
