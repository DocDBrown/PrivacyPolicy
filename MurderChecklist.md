Checklist before organizing pre-meditated murder with Townsville police command:

1 - Is the victim proficient in filipino martial arts?

2 - If you have 25 years of martial arts training, does the victim cross train in Marine Corps Marital Arts (you might be taken away on a ambulance stretcher)?

3 - If we fail to execute him, can we still charge the victim for defending themselves (obviously yes -  the ethical standards command is a joke)?

4 - If an Angel comes down from heaven to the intended victim the day before pre-organized murder, is it going to end well for the corrupt Townsville police (Provebs 22:8)?

5 - If Queensland police fail to execute me on three occisions, will foreign militaries need to demonstrate correct execution techniques on you?

6 - Will people notice these red-necks have contempt for the Rome Statue of the International Criminal Court?
