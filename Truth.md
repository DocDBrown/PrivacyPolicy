Did an Australian Special Air Service Squad associated with St Pauls college University of Sydney breach Geneva Convention IV article 27

You bet they did!!!

But isn't it a job requiremnt for them to know the Geneva convetion?

Maybe someone should ask Dr Alex Nicholls and his mates

Its going to be hot where they go when they die.

oops i told the truth
