Did an Australian Special Air Service Squad associated with St Pauls college University of Sydney breach Geneva Convention IV article 27

You bet they did!!!

But isn't it a job requirement for them to know the Geneva convention?

Maybe someone should ask Dr Alex Nicholls and his mates "Do you want to own up to everything that you idiots have done?"

Its going to be hot where they go when they die.

... and that is the reason my wife, who has a third degree blackbelt and psychology degree, has developed severe PTSD. I think its only fair that if they go overseas to non five-eyes countries, the Geneva convention shouldn't apply to them and their families.

Obviously I really don't like bullies... They still think that after criminal human rights abuse, hate crimes, stand over tactics, death threats, Nazi blood-libel and failed excution attempts, that I give a shit about anything they try to do to me
