Did an Australian Special Air Service Squad associated with St Pauls college University of Sydney breach Geneva Convention IV article 27

You bet they did!!!

But isn't it a job requirement for them to know the Geneva convention?

Maybe someone should ask Dr Alex Nicholls and his mates "Do you want to own up to everything that you idiots have done?" They must be guilty if other Australian shitheads are desperate to cover up for them.

Its going to be hot where they go when they die.
