If totalitarianism is inevitable with modern technology, then we need to create a 
world where human decency, justice and respect of other people is built into the 
system. The precise details of this are a bit coomplicated, as you can imagine. 
Everyone should be able to pursue life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
