When corrupt police charge the witnesses and victim's of violent drug crime for political puposes, 
You have to ask yourself: 
1. Why does Australia pretend to have any morality?
2. Why is political profiling more prevalent i n Australia?
3. Do they think anyone will notice corrupt police are charing victims of crime to cover up for perpetraotrs?
4. If victims, being charged because they are witnesses to drug crime, can supoena crime stoppers reports and passport records wil corrput cops get away with it?
5. If victims of crime are being charged for political puposes, are they 'pushovers' if they will take the corrupt police to the Australian High court, regardless of outcome.
